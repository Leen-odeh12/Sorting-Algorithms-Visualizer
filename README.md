# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer

 Sorting is a very classic problem of reordering items (that can be compared, e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc) of an array (or a list) in a certain order (increasing, non-decreasing (increasing or flat), decreasing, non-increasing (decreasing or flat), lexicographical, etc).


There are many different sorting algorithms, each has its own advantages and limitations.


Sorting is commonly used as the introductory problem in various Computer Science classes to showcase a range of algorithmic ideas.<br>
